# GURU - Home Services on Demand

## Model
Guru contracts with local service providers to deliver affordable home services on demand. 

People today want the luxury of a cleaning service, at a rate they can feel victorious about, and with the convenience we've come to expect. This is Guru.

Guru does this by acting as the small business platform for home service providers. Guru Business schedules services, tracks jobs in real time, provides service ratings from customers, and bills customers. 

Customer Acquisition for Guru is optimized by having service providers transition their existing customers over to Guru. In-app incentives encourage consumers to share their experience, therefore bringing additional users into the app. 

Guru is a free small business platform, and free consumer app. Guru simply takes a small percentage of each transaction as a processing fee. 

## Plan
Starting out, Guru will deliver a single service to consumers. The most ubiquitously loathed task across middle class homes, is cleaning. People hate doing it, and feel the need to do it every single day.

Once cleaning services have been successfully capitalized on, other services will be introduced into the app. 


## Prototype
This prototype is the consumer side of the experience. It goes through the general flow of what a consumer user would experience when first downloading the Guru app. Once a cleaning service is scheduled, the Guru Business app would take over and ensure the appointment is scheduled, provided, and billed. We are actively scoping out the business side, and intend to build them in tandem to ensure both users have a clean and delightful experience. 

## Future
This is simply the first prototype. It has elements in it that we've tested with consumers, and other elements that will need to be redesigned before we kick off actual development. Development will commence in May.
